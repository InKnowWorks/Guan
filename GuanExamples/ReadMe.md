## GuanExamples .NET Core (3.1) Console Application

Play around with Guan in a .NET Core 3.1 Console application. The idea is that if you know how to write logic rules, query expresssions, and predicates in Prolog, then this is how you can do so (mostly) in Guan. There are differences and extended capabilities. Guan is not 100% like Prolog today (nor is that the goal). You are welcome to help Guan get there, of course. For now, if you write .NET code, then Guan provides you with another familiar and convenient way to add logic programing to your .NET programs.
